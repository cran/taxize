taxize 0.0.6
===============

NEW FEATURES
* tax_name() accepts multiple ranks to query.
* tax_name() accepts vectors as input.
* tax_name() has an option to query both, NCBI and ITIS, in one call and return the union of both.
* new extractor function for iucn_summary(): iucn_status(), to extract status from iucn-objects.
* tax_agg(): A function to aggregate species data to given taxonomic rank.
* tax_rank(): Get taxonomic rank for a given taxon name.
* classification() accepts taxon names as input and returns a named list.
* new function apg_lookup() looks up APGIII taxonomy and replaces family names
* new function gni_parse() parses scientific names using EOl's name parser API
* new function iucn_getname() is a utility to find IUCN names using the EOL API
* new function rank_agg() aggregates data by a given taxonomic rank
* new data table apg_families
* new data table apg_orders
* gnr_resolve() gains new arguments gnr_resolvee_once, with_context, stripauthority, highestscore, and http, and loses returndf (that is, a data.frame is returned by default)
* gni_search() gains parameter parse_names

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* tnrs() parameter getpost changed from default of 'GET' to 'POST'
* Across all functions, the url parameter specifying an API endpoint was moved inside of functions (i.e., not available as a parameter in the function call)
* gnr_datasources() parameter todf=TRUE by default now, returning a data.frame
* col_classification() minor formatting improvements

BUG FIXES
* iucn_summary() returns no information about population estimates.
* get_tsn() raised a warning in specific situations.
* tax_name() did not work for multiple ranks with ITIS.
* fixed errors in getfullhierarchyfromtsn()
* fixed errors in gethierarchydownfromtsn()
* fixed errors in getsynonymnamesfromtsn()
* fixed errors in searchforanymatch()
* fixed errors in searchforanymatchedpage()

NOTES
* Removed dependency to NCBI2R
* Improvements of documentation
* Citation added
