# CONTRIBUTING #

### Please contribute! 
We love collaboration. 

### If you do contribute... 
clone, fork, make pull requests, etc., but if you could follow some guidelines that would be great!  This will help all code in rOpenSci repos be more consistent, so easier to use and edit.  Forking and sending pull requests back to the master branch of this repo are best. 

### Guidelines for contribution
We keep a continually updating list of guidelines for collaboration on our wiki in the [rOpenSci wiki](https://github.com/ropensci/rOpenSci/wiki/rOpenSci-Workflow-Document).  Please go there to see how to do things.  Also, you can just get in touch with us if you have any questions.
