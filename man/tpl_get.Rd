\description{
The Plant List \url{http://www.theplantlist.org/}. Note there is a package on
CRAN (taxonstand - \url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Taxonstand/})
that uses theplantlist.org to search plant names - we have a wrapper around
that function called tpl_search.
}
\details{
Throws a warning if you already have a directory of the one
provided, but still works. Writes to your home directory, change dir_ as needed.

# You can get mosses too!
tpl_get2(dir_ = "~/foo4", family = "Echinodiaceae")
