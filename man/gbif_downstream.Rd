\title{Retrieve all taxa names downstream in hierarchy for GBIF}
\usage{
gbif_downstream(key, downto, intermediate = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{A taxonomic serial number.}

\item{downto}{The taxonomic level you want to go down to. See examples below.
The taxonomic level IS case sensitive, and you do have to spell it
correctly. See \code{data(rank_ref)} for spelling.}

\item{intermediate}{(logical) If TRUE, return a list of length two with
target taxon rank names, with additional list of data.frame's of
intermediate taxonomic groups. Default: FALSE}

\item{...}{Further args passed on to \code{\link{gbif_name_usage}}}
}
\value{
Data.frame of taxonomic information downstream to family from e.g.,
		Order, Class, etc., or if \code{intermediated=TRUE}, list of length two,
  	with target taxon rank names, and intermediate names.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
## the plant class Bangiophyceae
gbif_downstream(key = 198, downto="genus")
gbif_downstream(key = 198, downto="genus", intermediate=TRUE)

# families downstream from the family Strepsiptera (twisted wing parasites)
gbif_downstream(key = 1227, "family")
## here, intermediate leads to the same result as the target
gbif_downstream(key = 1227, "family", intermediate=TRUE)

# Lepidoptera
gbif_downstream(key = 797, "family")

# get species downstream from the genus Ursus
gbif_downstream(key = 2433406, "species")

# get tribes down from the family Apidae
gbif_downstream(key = 7799978, downto="species")
gbif_downstream(key = 7799978, downto="species", intermediate=TRUE)
